# Repository for programming exercises of the Digital Musicology class 2021

The notebook in the tone_profiles directory describes your tasks and provides a data frame of pitch and interval sequences for each piece of the [Essen Folksong Database](http://esac-data.org).

Clone the repository, open the notebook, and play with the data!

### Anaconda

Anaconda provides the easiest entry point for Python newcomers and for us the easiest way to make sure our notebooks run on everyone's system. 

* If you don't have it installed already, please [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). The installer is >500 MB so make sure you install it with a good and unlimited internet connection.
* If you do, please bring conda up to date: `conda update -n base -c defaults conda`

> Unless you know what you're doing, use the `(Anaconda) Command Prompt` for all shell commands.
